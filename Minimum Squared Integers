Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 32 + 22 = 9 + 4.

Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 32 + 32 + 32 = 9 + 9 + 9.



Pseudo Code
Run code through root n to 1.
E.g. n=10
root 10 = 3.162....

run loop from 3-1
3^2 +1 =10
Number =2
2^2+2^2+1+1
Number =4, lowest =2
1X10
Number=10, lowest =2
Retuurn lowest

Is there a faster way?
