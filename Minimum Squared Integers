Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 32 + 22 = 9 + 4.

Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 32 + 32 + 32 = 9 + 9 + 9.



Pseudo Code
Run code through root n to 1.
E.g. n=10
root 10 = 3.162....

run loop from 3-1
3^2 +1 =10
Number =2
2^2+2^2+1+1
Number =4, lowest =2
1X10
Number=10, lowest =2
Retuurn lowest

Is there a faster way?
Use memoization


One naive recursive way of solving this problem would be to do the following:

Iterate i from 1 to sqrt(n)
Recursively compute the minimum number of squares needed to sum to n - i*i
Pick the min of those, plus 1
The base case would be when n = 0.

from math import inf

def num_squares_naive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    min_num_squares = inf

    i = 1
    while n - i*i >= 0:
        min_num_squares = min(min_num_squares, num_squares_naive(n - i*i) + 1)
        i += 1

    return min_num_squares
However, this takes exponential time. We can speed things up using a cache with dynamic programming, and using the same logic:

def num_squares(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    cache = [inf for i in range(n + 1)]
    cache[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        j = 1
        while j * j <= i:
            cache[i] = min(cache[i], cache[i - j*j] + 1)
            j += 1

    return cache[n]
Now this is O(n^2) time and O(n) space.
