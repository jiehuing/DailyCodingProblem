Given an array of positive integers, divide the array into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of the subsets is as small as possible.

For example, given [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], return the sets {10, 25} and {5, 15, 20}, which has a difference of 5, which is the smallest possible difference.


Interview Attempt:
Is the array sorted?
If yes, reverse list(assuming ascending) 
create two sets and respective sum counter
run a loop through each number
{
add numbers to smallest set
update counter
}


If the array not sorted?
